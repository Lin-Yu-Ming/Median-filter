• Noise and Images
➔Principal sources of noise in digital images: during image acquisition, during image transmission.
➔Image acquisition: image sensor might produce noise because of environmental conditions or quality of 
• sensing elements.
➔Image transmission: interference in the channel

• Different types of image noise
➔Most common noise found in image processing: Gaussian noise, Rayleigh noise, Gamma noise, Exponential noise, Uniform noise, Impulse noise.

• Median filter
➔Find the median of all pixel values within a fixed range and replace the original central pixel value with this median value.
➔Excellent at noise removal, without the smoothing effects that can occur with other smoothing filters .
➔Particularly good when salt and pepper noise is present
